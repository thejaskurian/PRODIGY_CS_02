## Simple Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation

This project is a straightforward image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to alter and restore image data. Users can encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic operations on pixel values, ensuring that the original image can be retrieved.

## Overview

This image encryption tool is designed to perform basic operations on pixel values for encrypting and decrypting images. The encryption and decryption processes are reversible, allowing the original image to be restored.

### Features

- **Image Encryption:** Encrypts an image by altering its pixel values through various operations.
- **Image Decryption:** Reverses the encryption process to restore the original image.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to select, encrypt, and decrypt images.

### How It Works

#### Pixel Manipulation Techniques

The tool uses basic pixel manipulation techniques, such as swapping pixel values or applying mathematical operations, to encrypt and decrypt images.
